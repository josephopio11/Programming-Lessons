Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that uses selfcontained
objects, which contain programming statements (methods) and data, and
which communicate with each other. This programming paradigm is often used to solve
more complex problems as it enables programmers to work with real life things.
Many procedural programming languages have been developed to support OOP. For
example, Java, Python and Visual Basic all allow programmers to use either procedural
programming or OOP.
Advantages of OOP Over Procedural Languages
The advantage of OOP is that it produces robust, more reliable code. The attributes can
only be manipulated using methods provided by the class definition. This means the
attributes are protected from accidental changes. Classes provided in module libraries are
thoroughly tested. If you use tried and tested building blocks to construct your program,
you are less likely to introduce bugs than when you write code from scratch.
